# pibot
The project goal is to create a basis for autonomous drive for a SunFounder's piCar-V

The vendor's python tutorial was used as a base for the software
- python/django web server to provide a remote control for the piCar
- camera streaming was rewriten to use openCV

Everything was upgraded to use current versions of tools
- Python 3.5
- Django 2.2
- openCV 4.1 - using slightly adjusted tutorial from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/26/install-opencv-4-on-your-raspberry-pi/
